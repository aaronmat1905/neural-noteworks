            "text/markdown": "Hey there! It's great to see you taking charge of your finances. Let's break down your goals and get you on the right track.\n\n### 1. Your Sri Lanka Trip Plan\n\nYou're aiming for a trip to Sri Lanka costing **₹45,000** and currently have **₹3,000** saved. This means you need to save an additional **₹42,000**.\n\nBased on a departure in mid-December (which the system has calculated as about 146 days from now), you'll need to save:\n\n*   **Weekly Savings Needed:** **₹2,013.70**\n*   **Daily Savings Needed:** **₹287.67**\n\nThat's a definite goal! Just **₹2,013.70 per week** until you're exploring the beautiful landscapes of Sri Lanka!\n\n### 2. Your Emergency Fund Goal\n\nGiven that you live alone, have monthly expenses of **₹25,000**, work in a startup with moderate job stability, and support two dependents (your mom and younger brother), having a robust emergency fund is absolutely crucial.\n\nA standard recommendation for someone in your situation is to have 6 months' worth of essential expenses saved.\n\n*   **Your Emergency Fund Goal:** **₹1,50,000** (This covers 6 months of your ₹25,000 monthly expenses).\n\nAchieving this goal will provide a significant financial safety net, allowing you to sleep better knowing your dependents and you are covered for a good period if unexpected events occur. To build this within a year, you'd aim to save approximately **₹12,500 per month** or **₹3,125 per week**.\n\n### 3. Subscription Audit: Where You're Wasting Money\n\nLet's look at your subscriptions to identify potential savings. You're currently spending a total of about **₹876.33 per month** on these services, which adds up to **₹10,516 annually**.\n\nHere's the breakdown and audit:\n\n*   **Netflix:** ₹649/month, ~10 hours/month (Cost per hour: ₹64.90)\n*   **Spotify:** ₹119/month, ~20 hours/month (Cost per hour: ₹5.95)\n*   **Notion AI:** ₹800/year (~₹66.67/month), ~5 hours/month (Cost per hour: ₹13.33)\n*   **Headspace:** ₹500/year (~₹41.67/month), ~1 hour/month (Cost per hour: ₹41.67)\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nBased on your usage, **Headspace** stands out as an underutilized subscription. You're spending ₹41.67 per month for just 1 hour of usage.\n\n*   **Potential Monthly Savings:** **₹41.67**\n*   **Potential Annual Savings:** **₹500.04**\n\n**Action:** I recommend canceling your **Headspace** subscription. If you find yourself using it more in the future, you can always re-subscribe. The other subscriptions appear to offer more value for your usage time.\n\n### Prioritizing Your Savings & Where to Allocate Funds\n\nNow, let's put it all together and prioritize your financial goals:\n\n1.  **Top Priority: Build Your Emergency Fund (Goal: ₹1,50,000)**\n    *   **Why:** This is your most critical financial safety net, especially with dependents and moderate job stability. It protects you from unforeseen circumstances like job loss, medical emergencies, or unexpected expenses without going into debt.\n    *   **Where to allocate savings:**\n        *   **Immediately:** The **₹41.67** you save each month from canceling Headspace should be the very first contribution to your emergency fund.\n        *   **Regularly:** Beyond the Headspace savings, you should prioritize finding ways to contribute consistently towards the **₹12,500/month (or ₹3,125/week)** goal for your emergency fund. This will likely involve reviewing other discretionary spending in your budget.\n\n2.  **Second Priority: Fund Your Sri Lanka Trip (Remaining: ₹42,000)**\n    *   **Why:** While important for your well-being, this is a discretionary expense. It's smart to have your safety net in progress before fully committing to larger discretionary goals.\n    *   **Where to allocate savings:** Once you have a solid plan and are consistently contributing a significant amount to your emergency fund, focus on dedicating **₹2,013.70 per week** specifically for your trip.\n\n**In summary, here’s your actionable plan:**\n\n*   **Cancel Headspace immediately** to save ₹41.67/month.\n*   **Direct the saved ₹41.67/month to your Emergency Fund.**\n*   **Review your budget** to find an additional **₹12,500 per month** (or ₹3,125/week) to consistently put towards your ₹1,50,000 emergency fund goal.\n*   Simultaneously, start putting aside **₹2,013.70 per week** for your Sri Lanka trip, once your emergency fund contributions are established and consistent.\n\nTaking control of your finances is a journey, and you're off to a fantastic start by proactively planning and identifying areas for improvement!"
